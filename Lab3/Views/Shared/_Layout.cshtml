            <strong>StyleSheet.css</strong> was placed in the dir wwwroot/css which was auto-generated by the IDE .NET project.
            The point of wwwroot is to place static files to be quickley called on outside of active code directories.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>_Layout.cshtml</strong> was placed in the Pages/Views/Shared dir.
            _Layout's purpose is to share a common look and attributes with other views forming a sites layout.
            The reason for putting it in Shared is to differentiate between indivdual view pages and views which share attributes to all pages.
